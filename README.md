## 📊 Understanding the Display

### Video Overlay

**Information Panel (Top-Left):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ VEHICLE COUNT: 23           │  ← Total crossed line
│ AVG SPEED: 55.3 km/h        │  ← Average of tracked vehicles
│ SPEEDING: 3                 │  ← Vehicles over limit
│ LIMIT: 60 km/h              │  ← Your speed limit
│ GPS: Banashankari, Bengaluru│  ← Location (English only)
│ 12.969792, 77.575404        │  ← Coordinates
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Vehicle Labels:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ ID:23 | 65.3 km/h       │  ← Vehicle ID and speed
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Color Coding:**
- 🟣 **Purple Box** = Normal speed (within limit)
- 🔴 **Red Box** = Speeding (over limit)
- 🔵 **Red Line** = Counting line
- 🟢 **Green Flash** = Vehicle counted (line flashes green)

---

### Statistics Dashboard

**Four Key Metrics:**

1. **Total Vehicles** 🚗
   - Vehicles that crossed the counting line
   - Final count for the session
   - This is your main result

2. **Speed Violations** ⚠️
   - Vehicles exceeding speed limit
   - Counted only once per vehicle
   - Used for violation rate calculation

3. **Average Speed** ⚡
   - Mean speed of all tracked vehicles
   - Only vehicles with valid speed readings
   - Useful for traffic flow analysis

4. **Vehicles Tracked** 🔄
   - Currently tracked vehicles
   - Changes as vehicles enter/leave frame
   - Usually 0 at end of video

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

### Speed Settings

**Confidence Threshold (0.1 - 0.9):**
- **0.15-0.25**: More detections, more false positives
- **0.25-0.35**: ✅ **Recommended** - Best balance
- **0.35-0.50**: Fewer false positives, may miss vehicles

**Speed Limit (km/h):**
- School Zone: 20-30 km/h
- Residential: 30-40 km/h
- City Road: 50-60 km/h
- Highway: 80-100 km/h
- Expressway: 100-120 km/h

**Pixels per Meter:**
- Must be calibrated for each camera position!
- Typical range: 5-20
- Highway (far camera): 15-25
- City street (close): 5-10

---

### SORT Tracker Parameters

Located in `web_interface_enhanced.py`:
```python
tracker = Sort(max_age=20, min_hits=3, iou_threshold=0.3)
```

**Parameters:**
- `max_age=20`: Keep tracking for 20 frames without detection
- `min_hits=3`: Need 3 detections before counting
- `iou_threshold=0.3`: Overlap threshold for matching

**When to adjust:**
- Heavy traffic → Increase `max_age` to 30
- Fast vehicles → Decrease `min_hits` to 2
- Many false detections → Increase `min_hits` to 4

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Map Not Loading
**Symptoms:** Blank or gray map area

**Solutions:**
```
✓ Check internet connection (map needs internet)
✓ Wait 5 seconds for map to load
✓ Refresh page (F5)
✓ Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
✓ Disable ad-blockers temporarily
```

---

#### 2. GPS Not Setting
**Symptoms:** Status stays "Click on Map"

**Solutions:**
```
✓ Make sure you CLICK (not hover) on map
✓ Look for marker appearing
✓ Try clicking again
✓ Check browser console (F12) for errors
✓ Verify internet connection (needs geocoding)
```

---

#### 3. Video Showing "????????"
**Symptoms:** Location shows as question marks in video

**Solution:** ✅ **Already Fixed!**
- System now automatically extracts English parts
- Video shows simplified English-only location
- Full address still available in reports and web interface

---

#### 4. Speed Showing 0 or Wrong
**Symptoms:** All speeds are 0 or wildly inaccurate

**Solutions:**
```
✓ Recalibrate pixels_per_meter (most common issue!)
✓ Use calibration tool: /calibration
✓ Ensure camera is stable (not moving)
✓ Check video quality (HD recommended)
✓ Verify FPS value is correct
```

**Verification:**
```
If speed seems off:
1. Process short test clip
2. Compare displayed speeds with known speeds
3. Adjust pixels_per_meter value
4. Reprocess and verify
```

---

#### 5. Analytics Chart Labels Overlapping
**Symptoms:** Unreadable text on location chart

**Solution:** ✅ **Already Fixed!**
- Labels now rotated 45 degrees
- Reduced font size
- Hover shows full address
- Table cells wrap text properly

---

#### 6. Video Not Playing in Browser
**Symptoms:** Processed video doesn't play

**Solutions:**
```
✓ Try different browser (Chrome best)
✓ Use download button and play locally
✓ Check if file exists in static/results/
✓ Verify file size is not 0
✓ Try VLC player for downloaded file
```

---

#### 7. Port Already in Use
**Symptoms:** Error: "Address already in use"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Linux/Mac
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
```

---

#### 8. Calibration Canvas Blank
**Symptoms:** No image shows after uploading video

**Solutions:**
```
✓ Use valid video format (MP4, AVI, MOV)
✓ Try shorter video (under 1 minute)
✓ Check file size (under 100MB)
✓ Verify video is not corrupted
✓ Try different video
```

---
